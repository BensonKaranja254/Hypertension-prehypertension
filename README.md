# Assessment of Risk Factors Causing Hypertension and Prehypertension  

This project focuses on analyzing the risk factors contributing to hypertension and prehypertension using a multinomial logistic regression model. By leveraging real-world data, the study investigates key determinants such as lifestyle, demographic, and health-related variables to uncover patterns and correlations.  

## Objectives  
- Identify and analyze the primary risk factors associated with hypertension and prehypertension.  
- Provide data-driven insights to inform preventive healthcare strategies.  
- Develop actionable recommendations to mitigate the prevalence of hypertension.  

## Key Features  
- **Data Analysis**: Utilized statistical techniques to explore and clean the dataset.  
- **Modeling**: Applied multinomial logistic regression for predictive insights.  
- **Visualization**: Created clear visual representations of risk factors and their impact.  
- **Recommendations**: Delivered solutions grounded in data analysis to address hypertension risks.  

This project demonstrates the power of data-driven approaches in understanding and addressing public health challenges.
